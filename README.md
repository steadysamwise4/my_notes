## Description <a name="description"></a>
<sub>_***Built With:***_</sub> <sub>JavaScript,HTML,CSS,ES6,Bootstrap,Node</sub> </br>
This was a bootcamp challenge project. We were given front end starter code, and our challenge was to write the back end using node.js and express.js. I struggled quite a bit getting everything to work correctly. I feel like I tried a hundred different ways to read and write to and from my json file. In the end, something was messed up with my file path. Once that was fixed, things went smoothly. It definitely was a learning experience, as that should have been one of the very first things that I checked and double checked. The extra work and study on express.js routes will be valuable for me to have spent the time. I'm getting there with the back end work, but this was kind of a humbling experience. It has shown me that I will benefit from much more time spent working and challenging myself in this area.
